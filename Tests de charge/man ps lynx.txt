     ps -   display status of current processes 
     

SYNOPSIS

     ps [afmnostxFT] [ r [ delay ] ] [ -p pid ] [ -u uid ] [ -g pgrp ] 
     

DESCRIPTION

     ps displays the current status of processes in the system and shows
     at the bottom of its display total memory used by the processes and
     memory available (In the case of virtual memory it will show virtual
     memory available). The statistics available for each process are as
     follows: 
     
     pid                 Process ID number.
     
     tid                 Thread ID number. If this thread is not the
                         initial thread of this process, the thread ID
                         number is followed by a plus sign (+).
     
     ppid                Process ID of the parent process.
     
     pgrp                Process group number.
     
     pri                 System priority.
     
     text                Size of text (executable code) segment, in terms
                         of 1KB units. If the text segment is being shared
                         with another process displayed by ps, the text
                         size is followed by an asterisk.
     
     stack               Size of the process stack segment.
     
     data                Size of the process data segment.
     
     sem                 Semaphore ID number on which process is waiting,
                         if any.
     
     time                User and system time used so far by the thread if
                         option t (includes thread IDs) is present.
                         Otherwise, user and system time used so far by
                         the process, given as follows:
     
                         ss.ss     Seconds (less than a minute)
     
                         mm:ss     Minutes and seconds (less than an hour).
     
                         hh:mm:ss  Hours, minutes and seconds (< 100 hours).
     
                         dd+hh:mm  Days, hours, and minutes (< 100 days).
     
                         ddddd+hh  Days and hours (at least 100 days).
     
     dev                 Control device of the process, as recorded in /dev.
     
     flags               Change value of process' (or thread's) flags.
     
     user                User name (based on effective user ID) of the
                         process owner.

                         C         Currently executing process (will
                                   usually be ps itself).
     
                         R         Ready to run, but not running.
     
                         S         Suspended by a signal (SIGSTOP,
                                   SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU).

     name                Pathname of the executing process or thread.
                         Currently, the operating system only maintains

                         or thread.
     
     By default, ps displays all processes with the same effective user ID
     as the current real user ID. 
     

OPTIONS

     a                   Includes processes owned by others.
     
     f                   Substitute the flags field for the dev field
     
     m                   Show memory usage display instead of normal
                         system use display. This option provides the
                         dlim, d%, slim, s%, and smem fields but leaves
                         out sem, time, dev, user, and S.
     
     n                   Includes the operating system "null"
                         pseudo-process in the output. The accumulated
                         time for the null process is an indication of
                         system idle time.
     
     o                   Includes the supervisor stack size and process
                         state segment size in the stack and data size
                         values.
     
     -p pid              Includes information for process pid.
     
     -g pgrp             Includes information for all processes with
                         process group number pgrp.
     
     r delay             Tells ps to indefinitely repeat. The display
                         (selected by the other options) is drawn at the
                         top of the CRT. By default, ps waits 10 seconds
                         between updates; delay may be given to increase
                         or decrease the update frequency.
     
     s                   Substitute the sem field for the time field.
     
     t                   Includes thread IDs.
     
     -u uid              Includes information for all processes owned by
                         user uid.
     
     x                   Includes processes, owned by you, with no control
                         device.
     
     F                   Show the number of files currently open for each
                         process or thread.
     
     T                   Includes stream tasks.
     

FILES

     /dev/mem            memory device, used to get information about
                         processes.

DIAGNOSTICS 

     Since ps cannot sample and display the status off all processes at
     the speed at which the processes run, its accuracy is limited.
